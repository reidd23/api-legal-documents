Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 3, 2025

Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how I collect, use, and handle information in relation to my personal use of the Pinterest and TikTok APIs for content management and analysis. This document is intended to comply with the requirements of these platforms for API access.

Information Collection and Use
I do not collect personal information from any individuals through my use of the Pinterest or TikTok APIs. The API access is used solely for:

Managing and updating my own Pinterest pins and TikTok content
Changing hyperlinks associated with my own content
Conducting keyword and trend research for my own content strategy
Analyzing performance metrics related to my own content
No data collected through the APIs will be shared with third parties, sold, or used for any commercial purposes beyond managing my own content.

Data Retention
Any data accessed through the Pinterest or TikTok APIs will only be used temporarily for the purposes of analysis and content updates. I do not maintain a database of user information or engagement metrics beyond what is necessary for my own content management.

Third-Party Services
My implementation does not integrate with or transfer data to any third-party services. All API interactions are conducted directly between my application and the Pinterest or TikTok platforms.

Data Security
I implement reasonable security measures to protect any information temporarily accessed through the APIs. Since the application runs locally for personal use only, data exposure risks are minimized.

Children's Privacy
My implementation of the Pinterest and TikTok APIs is not directed at or intended for use by children under 13 years of age. I do not knowingly collect any information from children.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted to this GitHub repository, and the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy will be revised accordingly.
